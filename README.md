KneePain Weather AI™ - Grumpy Alert™ Dashboard
```

# KneePain Weather AI™

**Hyper-Accurate Weather Forecasts Powered by Retirement Home Joints**

---

## Overview
KneePain Weather AI™ is the revolutionary (and completely humorous) way to predict weather using nothing but the aches, groans, and creaks of senior joints. Forget satellites, forget meteorologists — the truth is in the knees, hips, and backs of our beloved retirees. 🌩️🦵

## Features
- **Grumpy Alert™:** The louder the complaints, the stormier the forecast. Angry knees = thunderstorms. Mild back twinges = light drizzle. ☀️
- **Multiple Joint Sliders:** Track knee, hip, back, and shoulder pain levels for each resident.
- **Dynamic Emoji Dashboard:** Watch as emojis change in real-time to reflect maximum grumpiness.
- **Mobile-Friendly:** Works perfectly on small screens, so you can predict the weather on the go!
- **Grandkid Mode™:** Optional notifications to keep the family informed (or entertained) about weather severity.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in your browser, slide the joint pain levels, and watch the **Grumpy Alert™** emoji dynamically change. The higher the pain, the worse the weather!

```bash
# Just open in browser
open index.html
```

## Fun API Mock (For Devs)
```http
GET /weather?joint=kneeLeft&severity=7
Response: {
  "forecast": "Heavy rain in 3 hours",
  "grumpyAlertLevel": "High",
  "advice": "Grab your umbrella & Advil"
}
```
